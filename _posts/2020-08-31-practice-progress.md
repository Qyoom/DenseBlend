Just please note that you ran into major resistance with all of this required upgrading and installation a couple of weeks ago (during the heatwave) and were ready to give up on it. But you set it aside and got going on your other projects (Number Puzzle, Circuit Dominoes, even Bee Hive). And the work that you did do has enabled you continue now in your goal of publishing Dense Blend!

Whoa, way into the afternoon! I'd really like to get through this whole tutorial today, but I guess it might be more realistic to think about spending the whole week on it (it's Monday). Maybe by Friday or this weekend I can get DenseBlend published with my first two entries, Axelrod in color and the classic number puzzle. I will need to spend some time writing those entries and the basic "about" page content. My writing needs to be of much better quality this time around. Reader friendly, interesting, concise, thoughtful.
