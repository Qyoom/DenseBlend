Good productive day. I moved the ball forward on the circuits dominos game with implementation of logic gates that support currying which in turn will support function composition. And per my reflection above. I'm going to buy the functional javascript book. A good investment as it will plug me back into being able to reclaim and recover all years of studying Scala!

This is important information (tutorial) lying along the pathway to my implementation of the Circuit Dominoes game I’m exploring. This puts me back in touch with functional programming that I had put a lot of time into with my Scala study.
As I contemplate my motivation and rational for engaging in such a project I believe I’m hoping that such dynamic functional composition could be put to use to create dynamic, rich, complex behavior in socio-cultural agent/actor based simulations/games.
