Remember the bees. This world doesn't have to be 3D. It can easily be 2D. Think landscape. Essentially 2D. Think comb. 2D, geometric pattern. Bee dance. 2D. This is doable now that I'm studying models and d3. Will the hive survive. That is the data story. Will need research, but essentially the factors are:

- Surviving the winter. 
- Enough sun and warmth and food stored for energy. 
- Toxins in the environment.
- Availability of food sources. 
- Diseases.
- Splitting the Hive (Scaling, expansion).
- Predators (bears, humansâ€”can the bees fght them off?

What else?
How many bees in a hive? Each bee will be an autonomous agent with programmed behavior. Hives can be superimposed on real Google Earth places. Gardens can be planted. Flowers can also be data points. Pollen, nectar, bird predators, etc. Each bee can be pulled onto a screen and its data observed. The Queen birth cycles, the cycles of the season, the honey volume. This could also be a private hive where the honey is harvested and shared or given as gifts to friends, and there could actually be a tie in with real honey growers (private or commercial).

Start a hive. Start a hive mind. Interesting companion projects.
