As an exercise in Martin Odersky's Advance Scala course on Coursera a few years ago I coded logic circuits as in the context of functional composition. Ok, this is very geeky-techie mumbo jumbo to non-coders. But what I hope is that I can find a way to translate the computerese system of computer logic into an board game that would be fun for two or possibly more players.
