I used to see this toy in dime stores when I was a kid. I never actually had the focus or inclination to sort and solve it. This holds true today. The puzzle I felt inspired to solve was how to implement it in D3.js. I had been working with a series of grid-based visualizations. I wanted to start to experiment with movement in grid. This model sprang from my memory as a kind of simple variation and extension of the grid theme. The next actual puzzle to solve in order to make this project more interesting is to automate the sorting as an option for the user and as an example for interested coders.
