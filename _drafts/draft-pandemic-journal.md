But here’s what’s going on: I’ve been stuck isolating in my cramped little minivan 24/7 for the past several days. Before the pandemic I was seriously trying to commit to my fiction writing which I’ve been focused on for the past couple years. But fiction writing is so hard for me emotionally and psychologically. Coding, and specifically the set up I have for Thinking in Models, is where my brain power, focus, success, committment, and fun flows unhindered <!--more--> (mostly—I’ll perhaps be addressing the true anguish I’ve suffered in the past when trying to deal with seemingly unsurmountable technical problems—bugs—at some point soon; as soon as it rears its ugly little head.). The stress started building up (the real danger of getting sick—even seriously sick—and being laid off. I just needed a break and a fun stress-reducing outlet. So I started studying algebra and javascript again!

And I started thinking again about my past desire to model ideas inspired by Coen’s book From Cells to Civilization, agent modeling, and publishing game-like environments. And of course my blog Thinking in Models is the perfect context for this. It’s really just returning to that project once again (like an old friend).
